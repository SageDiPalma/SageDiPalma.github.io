                Hello and welcome!<br />
                My name is Sage DiPalma. I am a classically trained operatic
                coloratura soprano, instrumentalist, composer, and sound
                engineer who has decided to delve into the world of tech! I am
                based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<br /><br />

                I began studying classical guitar and piano around age 5, then
                lessons in classical voice at age 8. While growing up in a
                musical family, I often had to go on the road and assist my
                parents with carrying amps, mics, monitors, and cables, even
                plugging in and setting up equipment as well. When in the music
                studio, I would gasp in awe over the 48-channel mixing console
                in front of my eyes. And while I would enjoy the music, I always
                wanted to be part of the planning, recording, and
                behind-the-scenes work that made it possible for the musicians
                to record.<br /><br />

                My interest and desire began to shift into actionable
                experiences when I was an assistant to another musician, audio
                engineer, and (ironically) software developer during my teen
                years. There was a project to build, not use, but build a MOTM
                modular Moog analog synthesizer and I was uniquely given the
                task of assisting with this! So rather than just utilizing a
                great piece of machinery as a tool for enjoyment, I was using
                tools to create this machinery that would bring enjoyment as
                well as the satisfaction and sense of accomplishment that came
                with that. This was when I realized I enjoy difficult tasks and
                the value of skills like patience, perseverance, creativity, and
                the ‘beginner’s mind’ so that you always stay willing to open
                your mind to learn and grow.<br /><br />

                While in college, I was studying operatic voice and performing.
                Outside of my major, I studied audio engineering with a mentor
                and received some formal training as well. I was working with
                musicians on different aspects of their career development; From
                recording, to songwriting and utilizing web templates to provide
                other musicians and peers performer websites to appeal to
                clients, management, and the public. As a performer, It is very
                important to have your own website if you want to showcase your
                music, performance media, and press kits.<br /><br />

                The year that I graduated college I opened a storefront with a
                few friends to provide local Philadelphians with tech, video,
                audio, and repair services and products. My specialty was music
                hardware and software. Simultaneously working at a music studio
                and performing opera, my life was immersed in all things music!
                Philadelphia, being a city with a thriving arts and culture
                community, benefited from many of the services we provided.<br /><br />

                However, as the Covid-19 pandemic hit, there became an increased
                need to utilize services for online presence for performers and
                local companies to build and maintain their online presence in
                order to continue the transition. This pivotal moment for so
                many became my foundation for expanding my abilities so that I
                could become useful and relevant to the change that so many
                people and industries were experiencing. While in the tech business, I have seen how hardware devices have only become better with the increased enhancement in software and the cloud world!
                Which brings me to today, I look forward to utilizing the wonderful opportunity in my daily life.
                <br /><br />

                Which brings me to today, I look forward to utilizing the
                wonderful opportunity in my daily life.<br /><br />

                I am especially interested and passionate about understanding how things work. Now I can utilize that creativity and passion with development by improving on my weaknesses and turning them into my new strengths. I am also eternally grateful to the MIT XPro Program
                with Emeritus Learning for their patience and grace as I
                complete their program. Thank you to the learning facilitators,
                student success coordinators, and thank you to Dr.
                Abel Sanchez for his and Dr. John Williams for their efforts,
                education, and initiative to bring this wonderful program via
                the online sector making it possible for me to be a part of.<br /><br />

                Thank you kindly for everything!<br /><br />
